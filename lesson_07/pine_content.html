    <h3>Pine</h3>
    
    <p>A pine is any conifer tree or shrub in the genus Pinus of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae.  </p>
    
    <p>Pine trees are evergreen, coniferous resinous trees (or, rarely, shrubs) growing 3 to 80 metres (10 to 260 feet) tall, with the majority of species reaching 15 to 45 m (50 to 150 ft) tall. The smallest are Siberian dwarf pine and Potosi pinyon, and the tallest is an 83.45 m (273.8 ft) tall sugar pine located in Yosemite National Park</p>
